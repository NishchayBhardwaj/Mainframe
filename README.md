Assignments Overview
This document outlines multiple assignments related to JCL, COBOL, REXX, VSAM, and GDG. The tasks include file handling, sorting, duplicate elimination, conditional job execution, and VSAM/GDG management.

Assignment #1: Sorting & Duplicate Elimination (JCL)
Objective:
Manually create a Physical Sequential (PS) file using ISPF 3.2, containing 100 records of 80 bytes each. The primary key is between columns 13-20. Among these, 10 records are duplicates.

Task:
Use JCL SORT utility to:
Eliminate duplicate records
Sort the remaining 90 records based on the primary key
Concepts Covered:
File handling
Sorting in JCL
Duplicate elimination
Assignment #2: File Matching (COBOL)
Objective:
Create two PS files:

File1: 50 records, with the primary key in columns 13-20.
File2: 50 records, with the primary key in columns 21-28.
Task:
Write a COBOL program to:
Read both files
Identify matching records based on primary keys
Write matched records to File3
Concepts Covered:
File processing in COBOL
Record matching logic
Assignment #3: Sorting & Duplicate Removal (REXX)
Objective:
Create a PS file with 120 records of 100 bytes each, with a primary key in columns 25-32. There are 15 duplicate records.

Task:
Write a REXX script to:
Remove duplicate records
Sort the remaining 105 records based on the primary key
Concepts Covered:
REXX scripting
File handling & sorting
Data cleanup
Assignment #4: Conditional Sorting & Copying (JCL)
Objective:
Write a JCL job to:
Copy a PS/PO file into an output file in descending order
Compare the total record count before and after sorting
Keep the output file only if sorting is successful
Print an error message if sorting fails
Concepts Covered:
SORT utility in JCL
Conditional job execution
Error handling
Assignment #5: VSAM KSDS Handling (COBOL)
Objective:
Create a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) with:

Key: Customer ID (columns 1-8)
Data:
Customer Name (columns 9-40)
Address (columns 41-100)
Task:
Write a COBOL program to:
Insert 20 customer records into KSDS
Display records in ascending order
Search for a specific Customer ID and display the corresponding record
Concepts Covered:
VSAM KSDS creation & access
COBOL file handling
Assignment #6: GDG Management & Archiving (JCL)
Objective:
Create a GDG (Generation Data Group) base to store daily transaction logs.

Each generation contains 100-byte records with the structure:
Columns 1-10: Transaction ID
Columns 11-30: Transaction Date
Columns 31-100: Transaction Details
Task:
Write a JCL job to:
Add a new generation with 10 sample transactions
Use IDCAMS to list all existing generations
Archive the last 3 generations into a PS file and then delete them
Concepts Covered:
GDG base creation
Archiving and cleanup using JCL
Assignment #7: JCL & VSAM Operations
Objective:
Create and manage VSAM KSDS via JCL.
Task:
Write a JCL job to:
Step 1: Create a VSAM KSDS file using IDCAMS
Step 2: Load a pre-existing PS file into KSDS
Step 3: Run LISTCAT on KSDS and analyze the output
Concepts Covered:
VSAM KSDS creation
Loading and listing datasets in JCL
Assignment #8: GDG Management & Concatenation (JCL/REXX)
Objective:
Create a GDG base and manipulate multiple generations.
Task:
Create a GDG base with max generations.
Write records into four generations (each with 4 records, LRECL=40).
Write a REXX script or SORT JCL to:
Concatenate GDG(+1) and GDG(+4) into one PS file (LRECL=80, total records=4)
Concatenate GDG(+2) and GDG(+3) into another PS file (LRECL=80, total records=4)
Concepts Covered:
GDG file handling
Concatenation of GDG generations
Data management using REXX/JCL
Summary
These assignments provide hands-on experience with:

JCL: Sorting, data processing, VSAM, GDG
COBOL: File handling, record matching
REXX: Scripting for file operations
IDCAMS: VSAM and GDG management
By completing these tasks, you will strengthen your understanding of mainframe file handling, job execution, and data manipulation techniques.

Resources Required
Mainframe System with TSO/ISPF access
